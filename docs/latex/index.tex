Parse\+Li is a library for parsing \char`\"{}input files\char`\"{}. These input files can be theoretically for anything, or you can leave the input file blank and specify variables using a dictionary object. An input file is loaded using the provided \mbox{\hyperlink{include_2parselib_8hpp_af46fc274a075d84e9230cd0aab51649d}{Read\+Config()}} function. ~\newline
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{EXAMPLE INPUT FILE}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
In the top level directory is a working example input file {\ttfamily Example.\+in}.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{COMMENTS}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
A comment line is any line starting with a \textquotesingle{}\#\textquotesingle{}. You should be able to write whatever you want in a comment line, the parser will simply ignore it. ~\newline
 Example\+: ~\newline
 \begin{quote}
 \#\+This is a comment \end{quote}
The above line will leave a comment in your input file which will not be parsed. This may be useful for removing or modifying variables from an input file while leaving a trace of what was modified or removed.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{INTEGERS}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
An integer is any number without a decimal point. ~\newline
 Example\+: ~\newline
 \begin{quote}
 SOMEINT 1 \end{quote}
The above line will create a variable named \char`\"{}\+SOMEINT\char`\"{} with a value of 1.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{DOUBLES}\label{index_autotoc_md4}
A double is a number with a decimal place. Parse\+Li stores numbers with decimal points via the {\ttfamily double} C++ type (i.\+e. a double-\/precision floating point number). ~\newline
 Example\+: ~\newline
 \begin{quote}
 SOMEFLOAT 1.\+0 ~\newline
 Another\+Float 1.\+0e-\/5 \end{quote}
Both of the above formats are accepted and will return the expected result. ~\newline
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{STRINGS}\label{index_autotoc_md5}
A string is a collection of characters in some order. Parse\+Li stores this with the standard C++ {\ttfamily string} type. ~\newline
 Example\+: ~\newline
 \begin{quote}
 SOMESTRING Something ~\newline
 ANOTHERSTRING Something Else \end{quote}
Both of the above formats are accepted and will return the expected result. Note that string values may not cross multiple lines.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{INCLUDING OTHER INPUT FILES}\label{index_autotoc_md6}
Using the {\ttfamily include} keyword, you can specify a filename to be loaded in addition to the file currently being loaded. When the {\ttfamily include} keyword is processed, processing of the current file pauses until the {\ttfamily include}d file has been loaded. ~\newline
 Example\+: ~\newline
 \begin{quote}
 include Somefile \end{quote}
Note that the filename must not contain any spaces.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsection{ENFORCING A VALUE}\label{index_autotoc_md7}
In tandem with {\ttfamily include}, there is a keyword for {\ttfamily enforce} so that {\ttfamily include}d files can be made to match certain parameters. This is especially useful if an {\ttfamily include}d file only applies to certain conditions on the selected input file and any other condition will cause problems. ~\newline
 Using {\ttfamily enforce} creates a string type object, so if you intend to enforce a {\ttfamily double}, it must be specified twice\+: once as a double, and once as an {\ttfamily enforce}. The same applies to integers. ~\newline
 Example\+: ~\newline
 \begin{quote}
 enforce Some\+Important\+Property1 5 \#this will not create an integer object ~\newline
 enforce Some\+Important\+Property2 Some\+String \end{quote}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{FORMATTING TIPS}\label{index_autotoc_md8}
The formatting is mostly up to you, however you {\bfseries{should avoid leaving comments on the same line as variables}} to avoid that variable being incorrectly written or mistakenly set as the wrong type. ~\newline
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysection{READING AN INPUT FILE}\label{index_autotoc_md9}
First, you must create a dictionary object. ~\newline
 This is performed using the built-\/in {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classDict}{Dict}}} class which is described in the header. ~\newline
 You may read an input file by calling the {\ttfamily Read\+Config} function which returns {\ttfamily true} upon a successful read. You are expected to supply the filename, a pointer to a dictionary object, and (optionally) a boolean to define whether to print debug messages.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysection{ADDING VALUES TO DICTIONARY}\label{index_autotoc_md10}
If you want to add values to your dictionary which weren\textquotesingle{}t previously defined, you may do so by using the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classDict_a91e726d1a054d6b44162c21548b06d16}{Dict\+::add}}} function which should automatically detect whether you are supplying a {\ttfamily double}, an {\ttfamily int}, or an {\ttfamily std\+::string}. ~\newline
 When defining a custom value to add, it is possible to specify the variable name with a space (for example\+: {\ttfamily MY VARIABLE}), however this is bad practise. ~\newline
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysection{READING VALUES FROM DICTIONARY}\label{index_autotoc_md11}
To return a value from the dictionary object, simply call either {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classDict_acae8230f89a61d7e254b096734504b60}{Dict\+::\+Get\+Double}}}, {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classDict_a7e847326c83beab5f63e4611ac20a1c4}{Dict\+::\+Get\+Int}}}, or {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classDict_ae71da8ae901c4b95fd605409ab5056ca}{Dict\+::\+Get\+String}}} (depending on what you are trying to get). ~\newline
 Note that you must supply a key which matches exactly the variable definition from your input file. ~\newline
 If Parse\+Li cannot find the value for the corresponding key, it will throw an exception notifying you of the error. ~\newline
